# This program is for allowing user input and outputing the name
firstname, lastname = input("Enter your first and last name: ").split() # Split the input into two variables from the space

print(f"{firstname} {lastname} Rocks!") # put the variables into the string via {} to make it so we dont need to use the + operator
