alignGame
    set all spaces in gameBoard to " "

    set playerX to center of board
    set playerY to bottom of board

update
    sleepTime is 1000 / 5, meaning 5hz

    if playerMovingLeft, change x by -1
    if right, change x by 1

    create and update thread if needed

render
    clear the screen with escape chars and flushing

    set all board pieces to " "

    set player pieces to "P"

    set all block pieces to "B"

    print the board with .print
    with each y change, use println with no args to print a new line
